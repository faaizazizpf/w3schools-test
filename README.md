Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutorial on https://www.w3schools.com

I have cleared the different aspects of Git like adding to staging, committing changes with messages for logs and pushing to remote repo.
Also I have learned branches, which is duplication of the repo so to make changes.
Now I am currently at pull, a combination of fetch and merge.
This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.
